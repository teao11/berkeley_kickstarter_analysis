# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
This work was completed whilst working through module one (Excel). Please find some findings below:

We began by breaking out the outcome of campaign by start date below:

We found that the most successful month to start a Kickstarter campaign was May, with June and Feb also being solid months for performance.

We then broke out the outcome by parent category:

The theater parent category held the most kickstarter campaigns, and was one of three of the strongest performing categories (along w/ film & video and music). 57% (525) were successful.

Looking at descriptive statistics for successful and failed Kickstarter campaigns, we were able to generate the following statistics:

Some findings for these campaign goals include:
* The mean goal for successful campaigns was 52% less than failed kickstarter campaigns. The median for these two are closer however, so there are other reasons for campaigns failing vs. asking too much
* The mean was greater than the median in both cases, so the data skews to the right (meaning most data falls to the right, or positive side, of each distribution's peak)
* The mean vs. 3rd quartile for each are very similar, so successful / failed campaigns both have similar distributions

Some findings for these campaign pledges include:
* The median pledge amount for successful campaigns is $3K, so Louise should take this into consideration when identifying her Kickstarter goal

Some findings when investigating the goal / pledged amounts of Great Britain Musical Kickstarter Campaigns:

When looking at this chart, we are able to see:
* Outliers for both goals and pledges of these campaigns
* The mean is greater than the median, so the data is skewed to the right in both cases
* The upper quartile for pledges falls just below $2K, which is lower than the median goal set for these campaigns

Based on these findings, some recommendations for Louise would be:
* Starting her Kickstarter campaign in either February, May or June
* Attempting to have her play produced for as little as possible, as we see that failed kickstarter campaigns generally have a greater goal than successful campaigns
* Successful US campaigns have a median goal of $3K and a median pledge amount of $3K
* The upper quartile for pledges to GB musical kickstarter campaigns (~$1.8K ) falls below the median goal for the same campaigns ($2K)
